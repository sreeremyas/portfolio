                    <p>I'm a self-taught and passionate Frontend Developer who thrives on creativity, teamwork, and the joy of learning. My journey into web development began during my school days as a bioinformatics student, where I first encountered programming with Visual Basic and SQL. That early spark grew as I pursued a B.Sc. in Animation, driven by my love for learning new tools, drawing, and creating.
    
                        After graduating, I joined TCS as a Software Tester, where I worked for five years. Though I gained valuable experience in quality assurance, I found myself craving something more creative and hands-on. That longing led me to the world of frontend development, where I discovered a field that perfectly combines my technical skills with my creative passions. Since transitioning to web development, I've enjoyed every moment of building interactive, visually engaging user interfaces that enhance the web experience.
                        
                        Outside of work, I’m a jovial team player who loves karaoke, cooking, and exploring new places with my family. When I'm not coding, I’m often found gardening or spending quality time with my toddler, sharing in his wonder and curiosity for the world. I bring that same sense of curiosity, creativity, and joy into everything I create, and I look forward to growing further in this journey as a frontend developer.</p>
